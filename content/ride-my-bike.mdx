Six years ago, I wrote a [Medium post titled "What I Learned When I Fell Off My Bike."](https://medium.com/@baezor/lo-que-aprend%C3%AD-al-caerme-de-la-bicicleta-965c5085fe30) However, I didn't actually write about any lessons learned. I just wanted to use a catchy title to express my thoughts on a quote by Albert Einstein: 
> "Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving." 

I still believe that this idea holds true, but it's easier said than done. It can be challenging to keep moving forward, especially when facing new obstacles on a daily basis. Whether you're an entrepreneur dealing with business challenges, a parent raising a child, a student learning new things, or a programmer writing code and solving problems, it's hard to keep going. 

Sometimes, it's okay to fail and not meet your goals. It could be something as simple as missing a day of exercise or not finishing a book in a week. Life can feel like riding a bike in the middle of a hurricane, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed and exhausted. 

The most important thing is to get back up every time you fall and keep riding your bike. Thanks to my 23-year-old self for the reminder. I will keep moving forward.
